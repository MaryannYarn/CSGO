## Monster Classes
* The Krugs may just look moving rocks, but in fact they are very dangerous. They have a lot of hitpoints.
* The Gromp make look like a frog to you, but it actually packs a dangerous punch. Thankfully it is very fragile.
* The Sentinel make seem like a peaceful creature, however if provoked it could be one of the most dangerous monster out there.
They have very strong defenses.

*A gathering of only the bravest of all fighters, the WARRIOR class harbors increased HP, strength, and defense stats and excels at close-range combat.
